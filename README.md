Here's how it works:

1.Upon starting the application, the user is greeted and prompted to select their Excel file containing their collection data.

2.The program reads the Excel file and displays information, if any, such as the total number of cards in the collection and the total value of the collection.

3.The user is then presented with several options to modify their collection data, such as adding new cards, updating the prices for existing cards, and more.

4.The user can also choose to view their top 10 most expensive cards or the total value of their entire collection.

5.After each modification, the program will save the changes to the Excel file and print a timestamp of the modification.



Overall, Pokebinder is a simple yet powerful tool that helps Pokemon card collectors keep track of their collections and make informed decisions about buying, selling, and trading cards.
